# Concepts

Use "Prevail/Prevalence" instead of "Edge"?
Use "Disputed" instead of "Conflictive"
Use "First/Second Epoch" instead of "Pre-/Post-9/11"
Use "Destabilization Ops" instead of "Coup"

Prefer mention VP gains before Influence changes since we might reach the end condition of 10 VP.

Can don't have to mention a country more than once if we use ", then" clauses.

Can use "player" in addition to \[power/block] to signify the active player that played the Event.

As long as a powers' Influence is added or removed in a specific country we can default to TS wording of
"\["add"/"remove"] N \[power/block/"player"] Influence \["to"/"from"]".

Conditions can be expressed as a title followed by colon, as seen on TS cards such as East European Unrest
and the war cards' victory result pharagraph.

"\[type] effect:" replaces the phrase "put this card in play". These cards also stay in play, but by rule convention
rather than an explicit instruction in the card text. The types are Permanent, Continous, and Triggered.
Continous behaves like Permanent but indicates that another card exists that can cancel it.

When an effect is canceled the corresponding card is removed from game if marked with an asterix, otherwise it is moved
to the discard pile.

# Specific cards

Recurring:
Does "remove N Influence" without any restriction mean Influence for any player, including active player? Is it
intended to be forced to remove your own or should it say either "up to" or "N of another player's Influence" or
something in that spirit?

1, 6, 19:
Writing "-1" is superfluous when the text clearly states "subtract".
Use similar phrasing as TS for the effects of a successful roll.

2: Anti-globalization movement
Clarification: Minimum Ops value is still 1?
Closer to the TS wording for similar cards, more wordy but clearly states it's from this point in the turn,
and it clearly stats the value is decreased, skipping "-1".

3: Black Monday
Slots are associated with the NWO track, so that should be enough and we can skip "NWO" from the text.

6: Congo wars
Clarification: this card only count "external" Prevalence, not Prevalence in Congo itself?

8: Economic Crisis
Clarification: Is the removed Influence of the block that is checked for, or can it be any power (e.g. in first epoch,
can US remove EU if there is any East)?

9: EFTA agreement
As the text stands it could be played after during turn 6 and later. I think the intention is also to have it be
unplayable during turn 6-8, correct?

10:
Normalize the order where the powers are mentioned together, Russia before China.

12: Empire of war
Clarification: While it is obvious the Event only provide any benefit for the US, perhaps it should have the explicit
condition of only being playable by US? This should work correctly when initially played by an East player, right?

14: Fall of the Berlin Wall
By expressing the effect in a more step by step procedural way it says the same thing with a shorter text.

15, 66:
Clarification: Is the intent to allow the Event to be played by anyone, but to restrict the canceling ability?
'Guantanamo' restricts its activation to the US player, so similarly 'FSB creation' should be restricted to the Russian
player?
Clarification: Does the canceled Personality card go to the discard pile rather than being removed? Or in other words,
is the Event prevented from happening, or is its effect canceled with the same timing as the play of the Event and
since all Personality cards happens to be "remove events" they are then removed?

16:
Closer to the TS wording for similar cards, more wordy but clearly states it's from this point in the turn,
and it clearly stats the value is increased, skipping "+1".
Clarification: This is not meant to be limited to 4 Ops, as with the similar TS Events?
Clarification: was "your first played op" meant to mean an Ops during the players *next* AP, and only within the
current turn?

17:
Clarification: Is it mandatory to play one of the cards?

18:
No need to specify "if any" since the instructions of an Event happens to the degree possible. If there is no
Prevailing player then that part of the text simply does not happen, the additional Influence is always placed.

19:
Observation: an "inverted" war card, very interesting.
Italic emphasis on the inversion of the criteria

22:
Clarification: Is it "up to" in the case that US performs the Event?

25:
Misspelled country name, Libya.

26:
Clarification: Is it "up to" to avoid VP redistribution from removing VP below zero?

27:
Explicitly mentions the "discard pile".

29:
Make this an "put card into play" effect, now expressed as a triggered effect, which eventually returns to the discard
pile.

31:
While more wordy, dividing the text with First and Second Phase conditions makes it easier to read.
We use the term "immediately" to mean "without checking the game end condition in between".

32:
Clarification: does "N Influence", with no specified player that is, always mean "from any player"? Or should we spell
out "from any player" on other cards where it just says "N Influence"? Can this force the player to remove his own if
out of options, unless it also says "up to" in the sentence?
Clarification: What does "at 9/11" mean? When the '9/11 attacks' card is played as an Event, possibly even for Ops, or
the beginning of turn 5?

33:
Bold emphasis to make it clear there's a choice.
Clarification: The added Influene is Chinese?

35:
Clarification: Why is the "up to" phrase needed here?
Clarification: Is the Supremacy replaced if someone else has it currently, and does this follow Veto, Ahead, Second
Epoch limitations?

36:
Slots are associated with the NWO track, so that should be enough and we can skip "NWO" from the text.

38:
Bold emphasis to make it clear there's a choice.
Clarification: Is the "up to" to avoid being forced to remove your own Supremacy?

41:
Clarification: What does this mean for US Prevalence? Do they automaticaly have Prevalence either always or with at least one
Influence present, or does it only stop other players so US still need to have more than any other?

42:
Clarification: Remove Influence from whom?
RS: Anyone (let's say including yourself if you're the only one with influence)

44:
Clarification: Remove Influence from whom?
RS: Anyone
Clarification: Is the "up to" to avoid being forced to remove your own Influence?
RS: Not really. It's for the case where there are less than 2 influence to remove, to allow to play it for removing just 1 influence.
As I said previously, I did not consider the case that you play a card that will remove influence from you. But if you chose to play for text on a country where only you have influence and choose to remove influence, it's your fault, I won't make the game 'sweet' in that sense.

Clarification: Is the intent to remove Influence from only one of the two countries, Ukraine or Israel?
RS: yes, you choose one of them and remove 2 influence on the one chosen. Otherwise it might be very powerful. The wording it not very clear about it, i agree.

45:
Clarification: Why is the "up to" phrase needed here?
RS: Yes, always that there's the 'up to', the original intention was to make them playable if there are less than the influence in the text present to remove.
Clarification: Remove Influence from either two different or two from one?
RS: It's a powerhouse card, two from different (1 and 1) or two from the same.

47:
Clarification: Does US loss VP regardless of having existing Prevalence or not?
RS: Yes. The underlying theme it that the event made US 'vulnerable' as the only hegemon. At the same time, it make it stronger internally (on the west)

48:
Normalize the order where the powers are mentioned together, Russia before China.
Clarification: Original text had "(or 2 the East Block)". Does this refer to a 2p game where one player represent the
whole East Block?
RS: Yes

52:
Pretty sure it's the "Middle East", not "Middle West".
"US or EU Influence" is the same as "West Influence".
RS: Oh yes, big errata that was present in the previous version!
Clarification: Is this a remnant of earlier rules? It should be next East player *by Header Order*, right?
RS: Yes, it was a remnant, somehow this card was not revised.

53:
Clarification: Is the "up to" to avoid being forced to remove your own Influence?
RS: As above explained.

54:
Bold emphasis to make it clear there's a choice.
Clarification: Is the "up to" to avoid being forced to remove your own Influence?
RS: AAE
Clarification: Remove Influence from whom?
RS: Anyone. Anytime it says remove influence, is from any power with influence in the country.

55:
Clarification: 1/2/2 are the correct scores?
RS: Yes. 2/2/3 for Europe, 2/2/2 for Middle East, 1/2/2 for Asia, 1/1/2 for Africa and 0/1/2 for Americas
Why?

56:
I assume the order is important here, US adds Influence before EU.
RS: Yes, order is important
Clarification: Why is the "up to" phrase needed here?
RS: AAE

57:
Clarification: Should the term "immediately" be used here, similarly to 31?
RS: Yes.

59:
Opinion: This particular card has some political bias in my opinion, but on the other hand it's a game based on
political themes. Regardless of the cause it's still a fact the climate has implications, but while Economy directly or
indirectly contribute to production, I don't feel the connection to the Technology Slots are as strong. Communications
has a possible indirect connection, but it's very vague for the two other slots. Now, I understand that the card
probably fills a specific design space so you are probably not very eager to change it, so take this as mere commentary.
RS: Yes, it's a political game and also based on recent events, so I understand it can give way to perceived or actual biases.
I've tried mostly refer to wikipedia or other more or less objective views of conflicts, and also take a decade of distance from the present to leave things to settle down. 
I think it's very well established and withouth bias that climate change is real (ipcc, un says it, not me) and negative (on ecological and economical terms, millions are lost on extreme weather events, droughts and fires, as well of thousands of lives and biodiversity, they are several studies about it). So a global negative VP seemed logical, as superpowers are major contributors, although maybe not major sufferers. Usually VP losses represent actual geopolitical/economic losses, or public opinion/moral losses.
This card may be seen as both.
Game-wise, I needed on 2nd epoch several cards with negative VPs to avoid easy early wins.

61:
Opinion: Given your answer in the BGG thread, maybe the card title should somehow include that fact, that this is also
themed on the NATO expansion?
RS: The adhesions were generally not 'sold' as NATO expansions, althogh the facto one thing followed the other. But there were different points of views and in might have gone as a purely EU adhesion. To reflect the chance of 'altering' the real events (in case it's EU and not US who plays it) for a softer adhesion, I prefer keeping without NATO references. Also I want to stress EU in some cards, since otherwise the West is too US-9/11 focused.

62:
Clarification: Is the "up to" to avoid being forced to add Influence for the other player in your block?
RS: not really. Actually, here i think that the 'up to' is unnecessary.

65:
Clarification: Does "can" imply optionality, or is it mandatory to place Influence?
RS: gamewise, it would be stupid not to do it (unless you do some kind of non-binding pact with other player). We can leave it or removit it to make it mandatory.
Clarification: Is this a remnant of earlier rules? It should follow the *Header Order*, right?
RS: Yes, header order is the correct wording.

67:
Clarification: Should the effect be prevented from being played as an Event as well?
RS: I'll leave it only for ops. Event texts are somehow 'stronger' forces, and US has too many VP losses on 2nd epoch already.

70:
Clarification: What does "'9/11 attacks' are removed from the game" mean? that card (47) does not have an ongoing effect.
effect.
RS: That card 47 has been played by its text. In that case, as it is an asterisk card, it had been removed from the game.

71:
Normalize the order where the powers are mentioned together, US before EU.
RS: Agree

75:
Clarification: "token" == "Supremacy over a Slot"?
RS: Yes. In the 'analog' version, it is marked with a cube/token. But yes, better "supremacy over a slot"

76:
Misspelled country name, Libya.
Inquiry: Should we keep the reminder, losing Oil Production status within parenthesis?
RS: Isn't it already? The text i have in the latest version is:
"Remove Gaddafi from play (if not in play, Gaddafi cannot be played by its text for the remaining of the game). The player with the edge in Lybia (if any) loses 1VP and *Libya is no longer an oil production country*. Remove all influence in Lybia. Gain 1 influence in Lybia"

79:
The term "NWO" is used for the track, we should let the card have the proper full title.
RS: Agree. I had already thought the same, but somehow never changed it :)

80:
Opinion: The only card with a flavor text; more flavor on other cards, or none?
RS: I love flavors, but never was a priority at the current status of the game. We can think of flavours on cards with enough free text space!

81:
Clarification: add EU or player Influence?
RS: Both eastern adhesions have that double side of EU/NATO adhesion, so player influence. If it's EU, it will be more 'economic adhesion', if it's US, a more "NATO adhesion".

P1:
Clarification: Does "pick" mean the player get to see the other players hand, or is it a random selection?
RS: All the Pn cards are promo cards, and were never really hard-tested. This was considered both strong and funny, so it should read 'see another player's hand and play one of her cards..."
Promo cards are considered as optional, and also as 'treats's for different country versions in case of a kickstarter or something.
Clarification: Is switching the words optional or mandatory?
RS: Should be mandatory, given that you see the hand and select one. It's the spirit of the card: nothing is as it seems! I you don't recognize the guy in the picture, he's the "Smoking man" from X-files TV series :D
