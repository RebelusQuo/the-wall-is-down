# Concepts

Use "Prevail/Prevalence" instead of "Edge"? OK
Use "Disputed" instead of "Conflictive" OK
Use "First/Second Epoch" instead of "Pre-/Post-9/11" Mmmm, I'm unsure about this. It's true 1st/2nd epoch is easier in term of rules, but may lose the flavour theme around the 9/11 attacks.
Use "Destabilization Ops" instead of "Coup" OK. That was my intention but there are some coups remaining.

Prefer mention VP gains before Influence changes since we might reach the end condition of 10 VP. OK

Can don't have to mention a country more than once if we use ", then" clauses. OK

Can use "player" in addition to \[power/block] to signify the active player that played the Event. OK

As long as a powers' Influence is added or removed in a specific country we can default to TS wording of
"\["add"/"remove"] N \[power/block/"player"] Influence \["to"/"from"]".

Conditions can be expressed as a title followed by colon, as seen on TS cards such as East European Unrest
and the war cards' victory result pharagraph.

"\[type] effect:" replaces the phrase "put this card in play". These cards also stay in play, but by rule convention
rather than an explicit instruction in the card text. The types are Permanent, Continous, and Triggered.
Continous behaves like Permanent but indicates that another card exists that can cancel it.

When an effect is cancelled the corresponding card is removed from game if marked with an asterisk, otherwise it is moved
to the discard pile.

# Specific cards

Recurring:
Does "remove N Influence" without any restriction mean Influence for any player, including active player? Is it
intended to be forced to remove your own or should it say either "up to" or "N of another player's Influence" or
something in that spirit?
Rodrigo Santamar√≠a (RS): It means anyone, including yourself, although of course that should rarely be the choice. The spirit is to make it "up to", although forcing to be the exact number may be interesting, I think it will add difficulty to the playability.

1, 6, 19:
Writing "-1" is superfluous when the text clearly states "subtract".
Use similar phrasing as TS for the effects of a successful roll.
RS: Agree

2: Anti-globalization movement
Clarification: Minimum Ops value is still 1?
RS: Yes
Closer to the TS wording for similar cards, more wordy but clearly states it's from this point in the turn,
and it clearly stats the value is decreased, skipping "-1".
RS: Agree

3: Black Monday
Slots are associated with the NWO track, so that should be enough and we can skip "NWO" from the text.
RS: Agree

6: Congo wars
Clarification: this card only count "external" Prevalence, not Prevalence in Congo itself?
RS: Yes. I made all these African wars kind of similar but not identical. Maybe it's a bit confusing, but I did not want them to be clones. What do you think? Might be margin to make them more disimilar.

8: Economic Crisis
Clarification: Is the removed Influence of the block that is checked for, or can it be any power (e.g. in first epoch,
can US remove EU if there is any East)?
RS: Yes, the wording is confusing, it should read something like:
"If first epoch, remove 1 *East* influence on a country having East influence, and place 1 West influence on it. If second epoch, remove 1 *West* influence on a country having West influence, and place 1 East influence on it."
In this case, it should be mandatory to be able to remove the influence, hence the long wording.

9: EFTA agreement
As the text stands it could be played after during turn 6 and later. I think the intention is also to have it be
unplayable during turn 6-8, correct?
RS: Correct

10:
Normalize the order where the powers are mentioned together, Russia before China.
RS: Agree

12: Empire of war
Clarification: While it is obvious the Event only provide any benefit for the US, perhaps it should have the explicit
condition of only being playable by US? This should work correctly when initially played by an East player, right?
RS: The idea is that the text triggers if UE plays it by the texts, but it's the US who benefits from the Destabilizations.
Same if played by East players.


14: Fall of the Berlin Wall
By expressing the effect in a more step by step procedural way it says the same thing with a shorter text.
RS: Cool, I trust you in making it more readable :)

15, 66:
Clarification: Is the intent to allow the Event to be played by anyone, but to restrict the canceling ability?
'Guantanamo' restricts its activation to the US player, so similarly 'FSB creation' should be restricted to the Russian
player?
RS: Exactly. If the text triggers, these cards remain in play for the use of US/Russian players, independently of the player who triggered them.

Clarification: Does the canceled Personality card go to the discard pile rather than being removed? Or in other words,
is the Event prevented from happening, or is its effect canceled with the same timing as the play of the Event and
since all Personality cards happens to be "remove events" they are then removed?
RS: yes, it goes to the discard pile, which makes the Embassy Assylum a little more useful.


16:
Closer to the TS wording for similar cards, more wordy but clearly states it's from this point in the turn,
and it clearly stats the value is increased, skipping "+1".
RS: OK
Clarification: This is not meant to be limited to 4 Ops, as with the similar TS Events?
RS: No, it can go beyond 4, of course.

Clarification: was "your first played op" meant to mean an Ops during the players *next* AP, and only within the
current turn?
RS: Yes. Basically, the first card played after the header phase, if played for ops.

17:
Clarification: Is it mandatory to play one of the cards?
RS: Yes. That makes it a little more spicy :)
IMF is not infallible, after all.

18:
No need to specify "if any" since the instructions of an Event happens to the degree possible. If there is no
Prevailing player then that part of the text simply does not happen, the additional Influence is always placed.
RS: OK

19:
Observation: an "inverted" war card, very interesting.
Italic emphasis on the inversion of the criteria
RS: Glad you like it :) It's a very special conflict on a very compromised area, it required something different imho

22:
Clarification: Is it "up to" in the case that US performs the Event?
RS: No, it should be 1 influence always, even if played by US. UE has a very hard play with a very long border and several countries, it needs these support cards.

25:
Misspelled country name, Libya.
RS: Correct. There are other errata, as Botswana I think. They are corrected in the TWID-SOA folder in my github.

26:
Clarification: Is it "up to" to avoid VP redistribution from removing VP below zero?
RS: No, it's "up to" cause in 2-player games, the West player only loses 2VP. 

27:
Explicitly mentions the "discard pile".
RS: Ok

29:
Make this an "put card into play" effect, now expressed as a triggered effect, which eventually returns to the discard
pile.
RS: Agree

31:
While more wordy, dividing the text with First and Second Phase conditions makes it easier to read.
We use the term "immediately" to mean "without checking the game end condition in between".
RS: As you seem fit, ok.

32:
Clarification: does "N Influence", with no specified player that is, always mean "from any player"? Or should we spell
out "from any player" on other cards where it just says "N Influence"? Can this force the player to remove his own if
out of options, unless it also says "up to" in the sentence?
RS: "N Influence" is always from any player. Rarely a player will use it for removing from herself, or adding to others.
I haven't thought when running out of options. I think it's a rare case, and I don't have a formed opinion, but I incline to
make it mandatory instead of 'up to'.
Clarification: What does "at 9/11" mean? When the '9/11 attacks' card is played as an Event, possibly even for Ops, or
the beginning of turn 5?
RS: The beginning of turn 5. As I said, i like the Pre/Post 9/11 wording to keep the theme in-game. 1st/2nd epoch is more impersonal, although is clearer. I have not made my mind, what do you think? 1st/2nd epoch will also help for further expansion to 2014-2026 3rd epoch :D

33:
Bold emphasis to make it clear there's a choice.
Clarification: The added Influene is Chinese?
RS: Yes, the choice and the influence is Chinese. But again we can leave it unespecified, the sensitive move for the Chinese player is to add China influence. The text should read something like:
"China player chooses to add 1 influence on any country (except EU, Russia and US) or to remove 1 China influence in China to add 1 influence on three countries on three different regions."

35:
Clarification: Why is the "up to" phrase needed here?
RS: Well, in case it already have influence in 1 public opinion slot (1st epoch) or in 2 (2nd epoch), where would only be 1 remaining public opinion slot.
Clarification: Is the Supremacy replaced if someone else has it currently, and does this follow Veto, Ahead, Second
Epoch limitations?
RS: As it does not tells that it overcomes any of the rules limitations, it follows the veto/ahead/2nd epoch limitations. Also the supremacy limitations. This means that if someone has supremacy, gaining supremacy means removing the other player supremacy, not getting supremacy.

36:
Slots are associated with the NWO track, so that should be enough and we can skip "NWO" from the text.
RS: OK

38:
Bold emphasis to make it clear there's a choice.
Clarification: Is the "up to" to avoid being forced to remove your own Supremacy?
RS: It was intended in case that there is only 1 economy slot with supremacy from anyone, but as it is worded it has that additional effect, which is ok, as it is not the choice you will do in that case, you will select the other choice (or play it for ops)

41:
Clarification: What does this mean for US Prevalence? Do they automaticaly have Prevalence either always or with at least one
Influence present, or does it only stop other players so US still need to have more than any other?

42:
Clarification: Remove Influence from whom?

44:
Clarification: Remove Influence from whom?
Clarification: Is the "up to" to avoid being forced to remove your own Influence?
Clarification: Is the intent to remove Influence from only one of the two countries, Ukraine or Israel?

45:
Clarification: Why is the "up to" phrase needed here?
Clarification: Remove Influence from either two different or two from one?

47:
Clarification: Does US loss VP regardless of having existing Prevalence or not?

48:
Normalize the order where the powers are mentioned together, Russia before China.
Clarification: Original text had "(or 2 the East Block)". Does this refer to a 2p game where one player represent the
whole East Block?

52:
Pretty sure it's the "Middle East", not "Middle West".
"US or EU Influence" is the same as "West Influence".
Clarification: Is this a remnant of earlier rules? It should be next East player *by Header Order*, right?

53:
Clarification: Is the "up to" to avoid being forced to remove your own Influence?

54:
Bold emphasis to make it clear there's a choice.
Clarification: Is the "up to" to avoid being forced to remove your own Influence?
Clarification: Remove Influence from whom?

55:
Clarification: 1/2/2 are the correct scores?

56:
I assume the order is important here, US adds Influence before EU.
Clarification: Why is the "up to" phrase needed here?

57:
Clarification: Should the term "immediately" be used here, similarly to 31?

59:
Opinion: This particular card has some political bias in my opinion, but on the other hand it's a game based on
political themes. Regardless of the cause it's still a fact the climate has implications, but while Economy directly or
indirectly contribute to production, I don't feel the connection to the Technology Slots are as strong. Communications
has a possible indirect connection, but it's very vague for the two other slots. Now, I understand that the card
probably fills a specific design space so you are probably not very eager to change it, so take this as mere commentary.

61:
Opinion: Given your answer in the BGG thread, maybe the card title should somehow include that fact, that this is also
themed on the NATO expansion?

62:
Clarification: Is the "up to" to avoid being forced to add Influence for the other player in your block?

65:
Clarification: Does "can" imply optionality, or is it mandatory to place Influence?
Clarification: Is this a remnant of earlier rules? It should follow the *Header Order*, right?

67:
Clarification: Should the effect be prevented from being played as an Event as well?

70:
Clarification: What does "'9/11 attacks' are removed from the game" mean? that card (47) does not have an ongoing effect.
effect.

71:
Normalize the order where the powers are mentioned together, US before EU.

75:
Clarification: "token" == "Supremacy over a Slot"?

76:
Misspelled country name, Libya.
Inquiry: Should we keep the reminder, losing Oil Production status within parenthesis?

79:
The term "NWO" is used for the track, we should let the card have the proper full title.

80:
Opinion: The only card with a flavor text; more flavor on other cards, or none?

81:
Clarification: add EU or player Influence?

P1:
Clarification: Does "pick" mean the player get to see the other players hand, or is it a random selection?
Clarification: Is switching the words optional or mandatory?
